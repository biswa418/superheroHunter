# superheroHunter - using Marvel API

This project is on Marvel superhero search engine. 
API Used - Marvel API. 

We have fetched and displayed a list of characters on the home page. It loads random character each time it loads.
Also created a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query and if we click on search after typing the character name eg. 'Iron man', detail of superhero will be displayed and list of comics and series will also get displayed. (showed limited amount and link to more is attached in comics)
